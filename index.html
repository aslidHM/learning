<h1>Giant panda<h1>
<p>The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca; Chinese: 大熊猫; pinyin: dàxióngmāo),[5] also known as the panda bear or simply the panda, is a bear[6] native to south central China.[1] 
It is characterised by large, black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body. 
The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid.
